# Nocture Engine
A data-oriented 3D game engine built from scratch in modern C++20, focused on performance and clean architecture.

## Overview
Nocturne Engine is a learning project exploring low-level game engine design, featuring a custom Entity Component System and OpenGL rendering pipeline. Built to understand how modern game engines work under the hood.

## Current Features
### Core Systems:
Custom Entity Component System (ECS) architecture
GLFW window management and input handling

### Rendering:
OpenGL 3.3+ rendering context

### Build System:
CMake configuration
Git submodules for dependencies
Build scripts for quick compilation

### Architecture Highlights
The engine follows data-oriented design principles:

Contiguous component storage for cache efficiency
Separation of data (components) and behavior (systems)

## Building
### Requirements:
C++20 compatible compiler
CMake 3.15+
OpenGL 3.3+ compatible GPU

## Building
Use provided scripts.
